        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Will, and this is my 2<sup>nd</sup> time pursuing post-secondary
            education. Before enrolling at Algonquin College, I studied computer science at
            Carleton University. I graduated in 2021, but I was unsuccessful in finding any
            work in my field of study. (To be honest, I realized that I was not interested
            in a career as a software developer.) Instead, I worked a variety of different
            jobs including warehouse operations and wireless sales. I am currently employed
            as a host at a local escape room facility.

            I decided to return to school to gain some more employable skills and follow a
            new career path. I joined Algonquin's <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>
            program to develop the skills required for me to design, publish, and market my
            own <abbr title="tabletop roleplaying game">TTRPG</abbr> content. Ever since my
            first <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em> game at the age of 16, I have been a huge fan
            of the hobby. My dream is to make my living in the tabletop gaming industry both
            as a game designer and as a professional game master.
